# Project
```
This sign up form project was created with vue3 and was developed as part of my vue3 studies
and practice while taking a course by TheNetNinja on youtube. This is a front-end only
aplication. 
I chose the camp half blood theme for the project as a way to honor the Parcy Jackson series of books
```
## Project setup
```
npm install
```
### Extra files
```
the "MissionSelector.vue" file in the components folder is an extra bit
that i saved up to remember later and might use it to
create another practice page with the same theme
```
